  "summary": "Implemented a BTC donation details UI in the “Get Involved” → “Donate” section, including a configurable BTC address with copy-to-clipboard feedback, an expandable QR-code area, and a clear fallback message when no address is configured. However, the QR code generation appears to be a placeholder pattern rather than a properly scannable QR encoding of the BTC address, which may not meet the scannability acceptance criteria.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "When a BTC address is configured, the donation UI includes a scannable QR code representation of the BTC address (client-generated; no backend dependency).",
      "reason": "The added QR generator explicitly states it is a placeholder and not a proper QR encoding implementation, so the produced image may not be scannable as a QR code for the BTC address.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/lib/btcQr.ts (comments: \"simple SVG placeholder\" / \"placeholder implementation\" / \"real QR codes require proper encoding\")",
        "frontend/src/components/BtcDonationDetails.tsx (uses generateBtcQrCode + renders as <img src={qrCodeDataUrl} ...>)"

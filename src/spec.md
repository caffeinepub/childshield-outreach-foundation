# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Publish a public single-page landing site for “CHILDSHIELD OUTREACH FOUNDATION” at `/` with clear sections, navigation, a cohesive child-focused visual theme, basic SEO metadata, and embedded static generated images.

**Planned changes:**
- Build a single-page landing page at `/` titled “CHILDSHIELD OUTREACH FOUNDATION”.
- Add on-page navigation that scrolls to: Hero, About, What We Do/Programs, Get Involved/Support, Contact.
- Apply a consistent visual theme (colors/typography/spacing/component styling) suitable for a child-focused charity and not primarily blue-and-purple.
- Add basic SEO metadata: document title and a general, non-specific meta description.
- Add and render generated static assets (logo + hero/banner) from `frontend/public/assets/generated` (no backend image serving).

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can open the app root URL to view a themed, sectioned charity landing page with scroll navigation, a logo and hero illustration, and basic SEO/share metadata.
